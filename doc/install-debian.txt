Obtain the latest version of the following debian packages from:

https://code.google.com/p/phpmyca/downloads/list

phpmydb, phpmyca-sql-install, phpmyca, phpdbo-form-api, phpdbo-api,
db-install

If you maintain your own repository, you know what you are doing, do:

apt-get install phpmyca

To initialize the database, install the phpmyca-sql-install package on the
mysql server that will host the database.

apt-get install phpmyca-sql-install

If you don't maintain your own repository you will need to install each
debian package in the proper order.  Run dpkg -i for each of the packages
in the following order:

phpmydb
phpdbo-api
phpdbo-form-api
phpmyca

On the host where the database will reside, run dpkg -i for each of these
packages in the following order:

db-install
phpmyca-sql-install

To actually initialize the database, run:

db-install

It will prompt you for credentials that have permissions to drop and re-create
a database named phpMyCA.  Make sure the user exists before running it, for
example:

mysql> grant all privileges on phpMyCA.* to youruser@localhost identified by 'password';
mysql> flush privileges;

Apache Configuration

The config files reside in /etc/phpmyca/.

Copy openssl.conf-sample to openssl.conf, if you really know what you are
doing edit it to your needs.  Otherwise don't.

Copy phpmyca.php-sample to phpmyca.php and change WEBAPP_DB_USER and
WEBAPP_DB_PASS to whatever database credentials are appropriate, and possibly
WEBAPP_DB_HOST if the database server and web server are not the same host.

Take a look at apache.conf for an example of how to set the alias up.  If it
meets your needs the simplest aproach is:

cd /etc/apache2/conf.d
ln -sf /etc/phpmyca/apache.conf phpmyca.conf
/etc/init.d/apache2 restart

You should now be able to access the web interface at:

http://yourhost.com/phpmyca/

Good luck.
