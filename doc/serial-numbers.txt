Notes on Certificate Serial Numbers

Certificate serial numbers must be an integer, each certificate generated by a
CA certificate must have a unique serial number, and the number is defined as
fitting into 20 octets.  I have no idea what the upper limit is on this number
when you consider different character encodings take more octets than others.
For now I will just assume an integer up to 64 numbers long shall suffice.

Note when checking certificates the issuer distinguished name nad certificate
serial number should be unique in the universe.

Most clients that display certificate serial numbers show them in hex, not
decimal.  The only exception I have seen is konquerors crypto library.  PHP
cannot convert these with the use of gmp.  To convert them, use gmp_strval.

For example a verisign intermediate CA cert has a serial number of:

155787030203699453416017114780027413204

To see in hex:

gmp_strval('155787030203699453416017114780027413204',16);

Displays: 75337d9ab0e1233bae2d7de4469162d4

To see the hex string:

gmp_strval('0x75337d9ab0e1233bae2d7de4469162d4');
