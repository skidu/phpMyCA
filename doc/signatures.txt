Get $decryptedSig by unencrypting the $encryptedSig with the public key.

bin2hex($encryptedSig) gives you the signature displayed by cert utilities.

md5 on the der cert gives you the certificate fingerprint.

Run $decryptedSig through _parseAsn(), then bin2hex $ar[1][1][1] gives you
a sha1 signature of what?  Possibly the original cert minus the signature.
