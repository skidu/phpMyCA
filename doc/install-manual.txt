Obtain the latest version of the following tarballs from:

https://code.google.com/p/phpmyca/downloads/list

phpmyca, phpdbo-api

Note you need get root to do the remaining steps.

INSTALL PHPMYCA/CREATE DATABASE

Extract phpmyca to /usr/share/webapps and rename it.

mkdir -p /usr/share/webapps
cd /usr/share/webapps
tar xvfz /wherever/you/put/phpmyca-x.x.x.tar.gz
mv phpmyca-x.x.x phpmyca

Move some things around, get rid of some cruft.

cd /usr/share/webapps/phpmyca
mv config /etc/phpmyca
rm -r debian

Add the database user you will be using, for example:

mysql> grant all privileges on phpMyCA.* to youruser@localhost identified by 'password';
mysql> flush privileges;
mysql> quit;

Create the database:

cd sql
mysql -u youruser -p < phpMyCA.sql

After the database is created get rid of the sql directory.

cd /usr/share/webapps/phpmyca
rm -r sql

Edit the config files.

cd /etc/phpmyca
mv openssl.conf-sample openssl.conf
mv phpmyca.php-sample phpmyca.php

Only edit openssl.conf if you really know what you are doing.

Edit phpmyca.php to your needs.  In particular you need to change the database
settings to what is required in your environment.  I wouldn't suggest changing
anything else in that file unless you really know what you are doing.

INSTALL PHPDBO-API

Extract phpdbo-api to /usr/share/php, rename the directory, get rid of cruft.

mkdir -p /usr/share/php
cd /usr/share/php
tar xvfz /wherver/you/put/phpdbo-api-x.x.x.tar.gz
mv phpdbo-x.x.x phpdbo
rm -r phpdbo/debian

CONFIGURE APACHE

Explaining how to configure apache with the plethora of different custom
environments is an excercise in futility.  Take a look at
/etc/phpmyca/apache.conf for an example of how to set up an alias to get
it to work.  After adding an alias restart apache and access phpmyca at:

http://yourhost.com/phpmyca/

Lastly, get rid of this documentation directory, or move it elsewhere:

cd /usr/share/webapps/phpmyca
rm -r doc
